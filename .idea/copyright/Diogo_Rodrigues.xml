It has evolved a bit and at the moment this is what you've in hands. Nobody knows about its future so who knows if it won't evolve further? &#10;&#10;This was made as a tool to help players of Magic: The Gathering play their duels/matches easier in the XXI century. It was not to be a full replacement of the game and never will.&#10;&#10; I created this after watching a few Championship matches over Youtube and Twitch. They looked like crap and very painful to watch. The main reason is that , unless you're aware of everything (up to date with every single card and effect), it makes you feel lost. It's very like anti-returning/new players and one of many reasons why it's failing after being the number one game (the same can be said with many other card games).&#10; &#10; With this I'm not trying to make the game better but instead giving it a hand where I hope someone notices its existence and decides to take a step further into the right direction (like with many other similar apps around). Magic: The Gathering is an old game that needs to be actualized with the present in lots of aspects or it will always be &quot;the game that once was cool to play&quot;.&#10; &#10; Have fun and I hope this app ends being useful to someone.&#10; &#10; ==================================================================&#10; &#10; Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License&#10; https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/legalcode&#10; &#10; By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License (&quot;Public License&quot;).

If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.&#10;     No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.&#10;     Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.&#10;" />
